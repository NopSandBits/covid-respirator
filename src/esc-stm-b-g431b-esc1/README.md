# How to build:

First, download and install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) for your OS.

Then, open the _.project_ file and 'Build' the _Release_ flavor.

The resulting binary can be flashed from the IDE, or using an external tool such as [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html)

# How to tune:

You need to download and install:
- STM32Cube initialization code generator [STm32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)
- STM32 Motor Control Software Development Kit [X-CUBE-MCSDK](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-mcsdk.html)
